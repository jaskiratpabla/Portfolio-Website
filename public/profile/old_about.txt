Hi, my name is Jaskirat and welcome to my personal portfolio website! I am a fourth-year Bachelor of Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, with a specialization in Software Engineering and a minor in Economics. My curriculum has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, software design, and data analysis, complemented by an economic perspective on technology's impact on markets and society.

I am currently searching for Summer 2024 internship/co-op opportunities in any software-related or product manager positions. My goal is to leverage these opportunities to gain valuable work experience across a variety of roles, helping me to further hone my skills and contribute effectively to my future team.

As a fast learner, I have the ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and environments, ensuring that I can hit the ground running in any project I undertake. My eagerness to work both within and beyond my areas of expertise is driven by a genuine passion for exploring new challenges and expanding my knowledge and skillset. Whether it's diving into unfamiliar codebases, learning new programming languages, or collaborating on interdisciplinary projects, I am always ready to contribute my best work.

If you're an employer looking for an intern, or if you want to connect and discuss potential opportunities or shared interests, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always open to engaging in conversations and exploring how we can work together to create impactful solutions. Let's connect and make something great happen!
